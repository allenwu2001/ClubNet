    <h2>Donations</h2>
    <p>Our club depends on alumni! Contribute to either our <b>team fund</b> or our <b>social fund</b> to support the current members!</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Team Fund</h4>
    <p>Our team gets an annual contribution from the university towards our team fund, which covers league fees, transportation to games, and equipment. However, this is often not enough to cover our more expensive travel, including our annual Ivy League Tournament (check out our Instagram on the right for content)! Our ability to compete in this and other tournaments depends on generous alumni donations!</p>
    <p>If you would like to donate to our team fund, please choose <b>Friends of Men's Club Soccer</b> under "Campus Recreation" at <a target = "_blank" href = //makeagift.princeton.edu/Athletics/> this link!</a></p> 
    <br>
    <h4>Social Fund</h4>
    <p>Club soccer is more than just a sports team &#8212 we are a community! Throughout the year, we host several social events, from welcoming dinners for new members to MLS games in New York and Philadelphia. To fund these events, we typically collect dues from current members, but we never want finances to be a barrier for entry into our club. Thus, we have historically relied on alumni donations to provide financial aid for members who are unable to pay.</p>
    <p>If you would like to donate to our social fund, please do so via Venmo at <a target = "_blank" href=//venmo.com/ptonclubsoccer>this link</a>, or by scanning the QR code below.</p>
